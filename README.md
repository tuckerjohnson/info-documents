Resumes, lists of works, list of performances, CV, etc.

I write these in GROFF which is included in practically every linux distrobution.
Feel free to use any document as a template, but make sure to check out the GROFF
documentation to ensure that you are compiling the document correctly. I use a script
which is invoked through hotkey in VIM to compile GROFF and LATEX files on the fly.

These documents can be compiled with TROFF which is included in MAC OS.
